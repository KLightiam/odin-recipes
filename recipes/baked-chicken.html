    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup prepared barbecue sauce </li>
        <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup red wine</li>
        <li>¼ cup maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dry mustard powder </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin </li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Whisk together the barbecue sauce, soy sauce, 
            red wine, maple syrup, chili powder, dry mustard powder, 
            garlic powder, onion powder, and cumin in a bowl until 
            thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken breasts into a 9x13-inch baking dish, and pour the sauce over the chicken. 
            Turn the chicken pieces over in the sauce to coat both sides.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 40 minutes. 
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). 
            Remove the chicken from the baking dish, and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Pour the remaining sauce into a saucepan, place over medium heat, 
            and bring to a boil. Whisk the cornstarch and water together in a small bowl until smooth. 
            Whisk the cornstarch mixture into the sauce; reduce heat to a simmer, 
            and allow the sauce to thicken, whisking constantly.
            Return the chicken to the dish, 
            and pour the thickened sauce over the chicken to serve.</li>
    </ol>
